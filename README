Quick Install

- Install a slightly modified version of COMiniSatPS from 
  https://github.com/marekpiotrow/cominisatps somewhere. 
  Follow instructions in COMiniSatPS's README.

- Configure KP-MiniSat+ using the same "prefix" as for COMiniSatPS. This will
  set up include-paths etc in the most simple way.

- Build with "make" and install with "make install".
